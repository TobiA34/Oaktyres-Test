## Architecture 

The architecture this project is using is MVVM. I used MVVM to do unit tests easily.

## Requirements
- iOS 16.0+
- Xcode 12.5+

## Features

## Dark mode
The dark mode is used to change the interface of an app to light or dark. I use dark mode in my app when the user selects light or dark in the setting then the UI element will change depending on what theme has been chosen.

## Unit testing
This project includes unit testing to test the endpoint.

## Reusable Views

I created reusable views to reduce the line of code in a file and I can now use these views in multiple places. This helps me structure my code.

## API
API delivers a user response to a system and sends the systemâ€™s response back to a user and I use an API to get a beer from the Punk API.

## Launch Screen
I have created a launch screen with the logo of the app in the middle of the screen, so when the user launches the app this is the first screen they will see.

## Passing data
On the home view I have created a show more button in the beer view, when this is pressed it will pass data to the beer detail view screen and display more information on the screen.
